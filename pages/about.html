                <p> Our founder and CEO, Zack Alger, started repairing
                    his own phones when he was in college and trying
                    to save money. He found that many companies that
                    offered screen replair service would buy cheap screens
                    from china and charge 4 to 5 times their worth for
                    the repair. He found a way to offer budget screens
                    and high quality screens at the same time allowing him
                    to compete without loosing integrity.
